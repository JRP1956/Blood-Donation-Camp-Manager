# Blood-Donation-Camp-Manager
Blood Donation Camp Manager is a Java Swing desktop app that helps organizers register donors, search by blood group/location/name, schedule and track donations, and view reports and statistics. Data is persisted locally in CSV files, making it lightweight and easy to run without a database.
